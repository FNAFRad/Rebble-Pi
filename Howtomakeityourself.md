<h1>How To make it yourself</h1>
This is based on RPI OS (not RPI OS Lite)
So first step is to boot RPI OS on your pi!
Next make all your changes like desktop preinstalled apps etc. Rebble Pi has the Papirus Theme, Material Cursor and a Debian Boot Screen all from gnome-look If you want to see it go to Credits.md
Now is to make the .img For this Linux Distro I used GNOME Disk but you can use other software or maybe use the dd command
Next install Pishink and Shink your .img (Example: Unallocated Space, the Linux Distro went from 59GB to 14GB with Pishrink!)
Finally this is opcional but you can compress your .img to .img.xz to minimize the storage
That's All! See... It wasn't so bad :)
Enjoy your Linux Distro :)
